{"_id":29932,"name":"Hell Gates","crag":26,"description":"Start from the end of a poor path at the lowest part of the buttress. Climb the wall to the left of the obvious curving crack or the crack itself, then move right and climb deep pockets past threads to a belay in a cave. Make steep moves out of the cave into a groove. Climb the groove to a peg belay (this can be backed up with a good nut in the wall above). Some people abseil from this point (although this belay is on 3 vintage and rusty pegs tied with some very faded 11mm rope - make your own decision). The final pitch (4c) traverses the obvious rising break to the abseil point above Suspense. Alternatively you can use an abseil point above Earl of Perth.","guidebookDescription":"Fun and intriguing climbing that gives a memorable outing\r\nStart at a ledge just to the left of a slim curving crack on the right side of the face..\r\n1) 5a, 20m. Climb the wall just left of the crack, joining it at 4m. Follow the crack to ledges and a massive thread just above. Pull steeply through the bulge, thread, and continue past another thread to a body-size circular cave. Belay in the cave, and be sure to search out and sign the visitors' log book. Alternatively; from just below the massive thread, traverse up and rightwards to the base of a small corner and follow this to the lower of two horizontal breaks. Traverse the break left, past a peg, to the body-size circular cave..\r\n2) 5a, 12m. Climb steeply out of the cave on the right, peg, and follow a short groove to easier ground and belay on a ledge..\r\n3) 4b, 14m. Traverse left around the exposed arete into a corner (junction with Earl of Perth). Continue traversing left for 5m to a peg and climb up 5m to an abseil point at a large metal rock anchor.","guidebookPublisher":"ROCKFAX","height":71,"pitches":3,"climbType":2,"grade":{"grade":"HVS","type":"British"},"ukTechGrade":"5a","stars":3,"firstAscentionists":"Ed Drummond","firstAscentDate":"1965-05-15","totalTicks":344,"ticklists":[{"_id":5,"title":"Avon Gorge non-Extremes"},{"_id":262,"title":"Rockfax SW select - Avon gorge routes"},{"_id":317,"title":"West Country Climbs"}],"totalWishlists":30,"ascents":{"total":344,"lead":104,"followed":46,"alternateLeads":168,"unknown":26,"climbed":89,"onsight":203,"flash":5,"repeat":32,"redpoint":1,"dogged":10,"didNotFinish":4},"votes":{"total":0,"gradeType1":{"total":83,"hardHarderGradeCount":0,"harderGradeCount":0,"harderGradeValue":"E1","easyHarderGradeCount":1,"hardSameGradeCount":33,"sameGradeCount":43,"sameGradeValue":"HVS","easySameGradeCount":6,"hardEasierGradeCount":0,"easierGradeCount":0,"easierGradeValue":"VS","easyEasierGradeCount":0},"gradeType2":{"total":82,"hardHarderGradeCount":0,"harderGradeCount":1,"harderGradeValue":"5b","easyHarderGradeCount":2,"hardSameGradeCount":32,"sameGradeCount":45,"sameGradeValue":"5a","easySameGradeCount":2,"hardEasierGradeCount":0,"easierGradeCount":0,"easierGradeValue":"4c","easyEasierGradeCount":0},"stars":{"total":82,"stars3":70,"stars2":11,"stars1":1,"stars0":0,"bagOfShite":0}},"moderated":true,"photos":[{"_id":80876,"title":"Chris on the 3rd pitch of Hell Gates","copyright":"pandalover","thumbnail":{"width":105,"height":150},"crag":26,"climb":29932}],"complete":true}
